# Frontend-Web-Development-Site

Frontend Web Development Coursework Site

For my Course Work idea, I settled on making a mock portfolio site for people to use. I intend to use it myself after gradation  to not only highlight skills I have acquired  but to give me an online presence of my own.

Any images used are all license free and do not belong to anyone, the purpose of the site was to be used as a mock portfolio site which will eventually contain all my details.

Any images shown can be found here:

This is the same for Web Icons from Font Awesome which is an open source icon repository:

**Side note** - *Git sometimes needs a refresh to pull everything in*

Really enjoyed this assignment, I honestly appreciate all the work and effort that goes in from both lecturers. Sorry for the last-minute submission and commits but you gave me the extra time so I studied the JavaScript scrolling method used within.
