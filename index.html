                        Hi, my name is Alex. I am a final year computer science student from De Montfort University. Below is a small portfolio page showcasing the potential to display work and projects I have worked on. <br>
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, giving a place to list my achievements and education during study and work. Please find contact at the bottom. <br>
                        <br>
                        I am interested in all manner of roles within computer science, developing websites is a something I find interesting and enjoy all the possibilities with web media. I also like developing applications and databases, coding both the front and back end. <br>
                        <br>With my time in industry I have also taken to becoming a server engineer and have been on the front-line support for this role leasing with product owners and making sure reliability is met 24/7. 
                    </p>
